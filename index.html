            q1: `The correct answer is D:<br>Send them the mission, vision, and benefits of the program with the clarification of how the program will benefit the stakeholders and the organization.<br>Some stakeholders view the program benefits as change. The stakeholders resist change whenever they have not directly requested it, have not participated in creating it, do not understand the necessity for it, or are concerned with the effect of the change on them personally. SPM page#59<br>A: This is wrong because the understanding of expectations is already done and you know the supportive and resistive to the program.<br>B and C are wrong because you have to balance between activities related to mitigating the effect of stakeholders who view the program negatively and encouraging the active support of stakeholders who see the program as a positive contribution. SPM page#62.`,
            q2: `The correct answer is C:<br>For many programs, the program management office (PMO) is a core part of the program infrastructure. It supports the management and coordination of the program and component work. The PMO also establishes consistent policy, standards, and training for programs in the organization. Another key element of the program infrastructure is the program management information system (PMIS). A PMIS consists of tools used to collect, integrate, and communicate information critical to the effective management of one or more organizational programs. SPM page# 100.`,
            q3: `The correct answer is: D<br>You can't expect project-level issues to be resolved always at the project level. There may be some issues that better be resolved at the program level or higher. The remaining three options are most likely for an effective program governance structure.`,
            q4: `The correct answer is C:<br>Business case Programs are linked to the organization’s strategic plan to help the organization achieve its strategic goals and objectives and balance resource use and maximize value. The business case is developed to assess the investment of the program against its intended benefits. In this situation, improving the level of behavior and morality in the neighborhood is an example of the benefit of the program to consider when it is proposed to the Selection Committee. SPM Page# 35.<br>Examples of benefits: an improvement in employee morale or customer satisfaction or may include a benefit such as the reduced incidence of a health condition or disease. SPM page#44.`,
            q5: `The correct answer is A:<br>The benefits register is developed at the benefits identification phases and includes the following.:-1-List of planned benefits; 2- Mapping of the planned benefits to the program components, as reflected in the program roadmap; 3- Description of how each benefit will be measured; 4- Key performance indicators and thresholds for evaluating their achievement; 5- Risk assessment and probability for achieving the benefit; 6- Status or progress indicator for each benefit; 7- Target dates and milestones for benefits achievement; 8- Person, group, or organization responsible for delivering each benefit; 9- Establishment of processes for measuring progress against the benefits plan; and 10- Tracking and communications processes necessary to record program progress and report to stakeholders. Reference is the standard for program management page#47`,
            q6: `The correct answer is D:<br>The program master schedule is the top-level program planning document that defines the individual component schedules and dependencies among program components (individual components and program-level activities) required to achieve the program goals.<br>The Master schedule includes.<br>- Component milestones that represent output to the program or share interdependency with other components.<br>- The program master schedule should also include activities that are unique to the program including, but not limited to:-<br>- activities related to stakeholder engagement<br>- Program-level risk mitigation activities.<br>- Program-level reviews.<br>SPM page# 121.<br>B: is wrong, because of no activities in the roadmaps. The roadmap includes major milestones and decision points. The program roadmap is a chronological representation of a program’s intended direction, graphically depicting dependencies between major milestones and decision points, which reflect the linkage between the business strategy and the program work. SPM page# 36. The roadmap reflects the pace at which benefits are realized and serves as a basis for the transition and integration of new capabilities. The roadmap describes evolving aspects of the program including incremental benefits delivery. SPM PAGE# 50.<br>C: is wrong because Program Architecture maps how the components will deliver the capabilities and outcomes. And no activities in the architecture. SPM PAGE# 50.<br>A: is wrong because of no any activities in the benefits register. The benefits register collects and lists the planned benefits for the program and is used to measure and communicate the delivery of benefits throughout the duration of the program. SPM page# 47.`,
            q7: `The correct answer is B:<br>The program charter, business case, and the benefits register can not be submitted to any stakeholders, because contain the investments, calculations, profits, and very important data can't be published to all stakeholders. The best option is the program's high-level scope statement can be published to all stakeholders. It contains the major product, service, or result with features and functions at a high level.`,
            q8: `The correct answer is A:<br>The business case serves as a formal declaration of the value that the program is expected to deliver and a justification for the resources that will be expended to deliver it. SPM Page# 35.<br>B and C are wrong because the stakeholders already available and are contributing to the program activities.<br>D is wrong because no any values are documented in the benefits register.`,
            q9: `The correct answer is B:<br>Cost to Benefits Ratio = CBR = Cost/Benefits.<br>If the benefit increased the CBR will be decreased.<br>So the lowest value will be selected CBR=0.5`,
            q10: `The correct answer is C:<br>The stakeholder register lists the stakeholders and categorizes their relationship to the program, their ability to influence the program outcome, their degree of support for the program, and other characteristics or attributes the program manager feels could influence the stakeholders’ perception and the program’s outcomes. SPM page# 60.<br>Once all major stakeholders are listed in the stakeholder register, the program manager will categorize them in order to start analyzing them. The categorization will highlight differences in their needs, expectations, or influence. SPM page# 62.`,
            q11: `The correct answer is D:<br>According to the data in the table, all projects are late with SPI less than one and all projects under budget with CPI more than one. So option D is correct.`,
            q12: `The correct answer is C:<br>When the structure of the organization is not mentioned in the question, you should consider it as a matrix organization.<br>The functional manager focuses on providing management oversight for a functional or business unit. When resources are unavailable within the program, the program manager calls upon the larger organization for assistance. When necessary, the program manager should work with the organization to develop a statement of work (SOW) to contract the necessary resources.<br>A: is wrong because the human resources are outside the control of your colleagues.<br>B: is wrong because the human resource team is under the control of the functional manager. So you can't contact them directly.<br>D: is wrong because you have to check the resources in your organization. If not available you should work with the organization to develop a statement of work (SOW) to contract the necessary resources.`,
            q13: `The correct answer is D:<br>A: is wrong because, the business case contains analyses, business needs, and others that can be used to establish and describe the high-level scope boundaries.<br>B: is wrong because the Program Charter contains the high-level scope, so it contains high-level scope boundaries.<br>C: is wrong because the program WBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchical decomposition encompassing the total scope of the program, and it includes the deliverables to be produced by the constituent components. The program WBS provides an overview of the program and shows how each component contributes to the objectives of the program. SPM page# 123.<br>D: is correct because the program scope statement contains the program scope boundaries which are defining what's included in the program scope—and what's excluded. It clearly defines the extent of the program scope.<br>The assessment of program scope, which includes boundaries, links to other programs/projects, and ongoing activities, is required as part of the program charter and to support initial cost, change, resource, risk, and schedule assessments. This initial program scope assessment develops the program scope statement from the program goals and objectives. SPM page# 110.`,
            q14: `The correct answer is B:<br>You have to ask all component managers to say their point of view, because If you ask him alone, he may be embarrassed in front of others. In case if he doesn't say his point of view, you have to meet him alone in your office to discuss the reasons, then take the decision, either send him for communication training if he has a problem in the communication skills or escalate to the governance board or the Sponsor if he doesn't care.`,
            q15: `The correct answer is C:<br>A program sponsor is an individual or a group that provides resources and support for the program and is accountable for enabling success. The program sponsor is often the champion of the program. SPM Page# 61.<br>the program sponsor is required to drive changes through the organization so that operations can accommodate capabilities delivered by the program, and secure the available positive benefits, and steward the handling of negative benefits. As such, the sponsor is integral to the communication and stakeholder processes. SPM Page# 80.`,
            q16: `The correct answer is C<br>Resource prioritization allows the program manager to prioritize the use of resources that are not available in abundance and to optimize their use across all components within the program. SPM page# 133.<br>The program resources management plan also describes the guidelines for making program resource prioritization decisions and resolving resource conflicts. SPM page# 119.<br>A: is wrong, because you have to optimize the use of scarce resources.<br>B: is wrong, because the question doesn't mention that the two components are interdependent.<br>D: is wrong because the resource prioritization decisions should be based on the guidelines in the program resource management plan, not the senior consultant.`,
            q17: `The correct answer is C:<br>Documentation of the metrics and the KPIs in the program stakeholder engagement plan before the approval of them as a part of the stakeholder engagement plan. A stakeholder engagement plan is a subsidiary plan in the program management plan.<br>The plan defines the metrics used to measure the performance of stakeholder engagement activities. This could include measures of participation in meetings and other communication channels, and the degree of active or passive support or resistance, and can also strive to measure the effectiveness of the engagement in meeting its intended goal. SPM page#64`,
            q18: `The correct answer is C:<br>The receiving entity should have a clear understanding of the capabilities or results to be transitioned and what is required for the entity to successfully sustain the benefits. All pertinent documents, training and materials, supporting systems, facilities, and personnel are typically provided during the transition and may include transition meetings and conferences. SPM page#54.`,
            q19: `The correct answer is D:<br>C and D are correct, but you have to evaluate the stakeholders' expectation of program benefits delivery before their ability to influence the outcome of the program. So the first step is D.<br>As part of the stakeholder analysis and engagement planning, the following aspects for each stakeholder are taken into consideration:<br>1- Organizational culture and acceptance of change,<br>2- Attitudes about the program and its sponsors,<br>3- Relevant phase(s) applicable to stakeholders specific engagement,<br>4- Expectation of program benefits delivery.<br>5- Degree of support or opposition to the program benefits.<br>6- Ability to influence the outcome of the program.<br>SPM page#64.`,
            q20: `The correct answer is C:<br>A and D are wrong because they will be updated later after stakeholder identification. The benefits are based on the stakeholder expectations. The purpose of the benefits identification phase is to analyze the available information about organizational and business strategies, internal and external influences, and program drivers to identify and qualify the benefits that program stakeholders expect to realize. SPM Page# 46.<br>B: is wrong because of the understanding of the stakeholders' needs and expectations after the stakeholders' identification.`,
            q21: `The correct answer is D:<br>Defining and prioritizing program components and their interdependencies is one of the activities that make up benefits analysis and planning.<br>The purpose of the benefits analysis and planning phase is to establish the program benefits management plan and develop the benefits metrics and framework for monitoring and controlling both the components and the measurement of benefits within the program. SPM Page#48.`,
            q22: `The correct answer is D:<br>the program roadmap can be used to show how benefits are delivered within major stages or milestones; however, it may include the component details, their durations, and contributions to benefits. SPM page#37.<br>The roadmap is an effective way to communicate the overarching plan and benefits to stakeholders to build and maintain advocacy. 37<br>A and B are wrong because they don't contain milestones.<br>C: is wrong doesn't contain a milestones plan.`,

            q26: `The correct answer is A:<br>You have to give training to the component managers on the program benefits, objectives, goals, program strategy, and interdependencies between the components to know how to identify the risks and issues that may impact other components and to know which risk and issue will be escalated to the program manager.<br>B, C, and D are wrong because these options can not learn them how to recover their weak points.`,
            q27: `The correct answer is D:<br>The program change request is a formal proposal to modify any program document, deliverable, or baseline. Program change request steps are:-<br>1- Record the change request in the program change log.<br>2- analyzed the change request to determine their urgency and impact on program baseline elements and other program components.<br>3- Submit to the program governance board for the decision if more than your authority.<br>4- Update the change log once the decision on the program change request has been made by you or the program steering committee.<br>5- Update the impacted areas in the program.<br>6- Update the program management plan.<br>7- Reflect the updates to component plans, as warranted.<br>8- Communicate the decision and changes to the appropriate stakeholders, according to the program communications management plan.<br>9- Implement the approved change request by the program team.`,
            q28: `The correct answer is A:<br>The program manager is responsible for monitoring and managing program risks, performance, and communications. SPM page# 83.<br>Program managers spend a significant amount of time and effort communicating with the program stakeholders, including the program team, component teams, component managers, customers, and program sponsor. SPM page#112.<br>B: is wrong, PMO is supporting program communications.

The sponsor provides valuable guidance and support to the program manager. SPM Page# 20`,
            q29: `The correct answer is B:<br>Typical financial management activities during the delivery phase include:<br>- Identifying factors that create changes to the budget baseline,<br>- Monitoring the environmental factors for potential impacts,<br>- Managing changes when they occur,<br>- Monitoring costs reallocation impact and results among components,<br>- Monitoring contract expenditures to ensure funds are disbursed in accordance with the contracts,<br>-Implementing earned value management (schedule performance index, cost performance index),<br>- Identifying impacts to the program components from overruns or underruns,<br>- Communicating changes to the budget baseline to the governance groups and to the auditors (at both the program and component levels), and<br>- Managing the expenditure on the program infrastructure to ensure costs are within expected parameters. The standard for program management SPM page# 128.`,
            q30: `The correct answer is A: When conducting environmental analysis for a strategic initiative and/or business case, it is important to consider that competing efforts may reside within or external to the organization. A typical business case includes analysis and comparison against real or hypothetical alternative scenarios. Where appropriate, comparative advantage analysis may also include what-if analyses to illustrate how the program’s objectives and intended benefits could be achieved by other means. Reference is Standard for program management page#39.`,
            q31: `The correct answer is B: Organization’s vision and mission are used as input to the strategic planning cycle and are reflected throughout the strategic plan. The strategic planning cycle results in the creation or update of the organization’s strategic goals and objectives which is documented in the organization’s strategic plan. The Values are the least significant element because they will be achieved after the usage of the benefits. "Organizations build strategy to define how their vision will be achieved. The completion of the strategic planning cycle results in the creation or update of the organization’s strategic goals and objectives which is documented in the organization’s strategic plan. The organization’s vision and mission are used as input to the strategic planning cycle and are reflected throughout the strategic plan."Reference is Standard for program management page#35.`,
            q32: `The correct answer is B: Program periodic health checks, generally held between decision-point reviews, assess a program’s ongoing performance and progress toward the realization and sustainment of benefits. The importance and use of these reviews increase when there is an extended period between scheduled decision-point reviews. Reference is Standard for program management page# 76. The number of change requests and the program risk tolerance can affect the number of the decision point reviews that will increase or decrease the period between them. Not all change requests can trigger the governance reviews, only the change requests for adding or closing a component. Other change requests can be under the program manager's authority, no need for decision point reviews. (Decision point reviews often are conducted at times that coincide with the initiation or completion of significant segments of a program to enable governance to approve or disapprove the passage of a program from one significant segment to another. They also facilitate the review and approval of any required changes to the program at key decision points. Reference is Standard for program management page#75). The frequency of program reviews and the specific requirements of those reviews may reflect the autonomy given to the program team to oversee and manage the program.

Reference is Standard for program management Page#73.`,
            q34: `The correct answer is D. Now you are in the delivery phase. A is wrong because the program charter includes the recommended Program governance that will be updated in the program governance plan." What is the recommended governance structure to manage, control, and support the program? What are the recommended governance structures to guide and oversee the program components, including reporting requirements? What authority does the program manager possess? This information is updated in the program governance plan." SPM Page# 83 B is wrong; the Business case includes the authority of the sponsorship only not the program manager. C is wrong, no authority includes in the roadmap. D is correct; the program governance plan describes the structure and composition of the group of governance participants and defines the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders. The plan defines who will have accountability and authority with respect to key decision-making categories and responsibility boundaries.SPM Page# 70.`,
            q35: `The correct answer is C: A program change request is a formal proposal to modify any program document, deliverable, or baseline. So the request after approving the program management plan means during the delivery phase. SPM page #125. During the course of program delivery, change requests that fall within the program manager’s authority level will be approved or rejected to manage performance and any changes to the program management plan. And any changes out of the program manager authority should be escalated to the program governance board. SPM page#100.`,

            q37: `The correct answer is B: Program performance reports include a summary of the progress of all program components. They describe whether the program’s goals will be met and benefits will be successfully delivered according to plan. These reports generally provide current status information about what work has been accomplished (especially milestones and phase gates); what work remains to be completed; earned value; and risks, issues, and changes under consideration. SPM Page#101.`,
            q38: `The correct answer is C: A- is wrong because the program manager will not escalate any things without recommendations. And maybe the matter under the authority of the program manager doesn't need escalation. B- is wrong, the program manager didn't decide yet that the program will be recommended for closing. C- is correct: There is no any decision for closing the project yet. The program manager has to analyze the impact of the misalignment issue and the closing project risk on the program. Maybe the program manager can realign the project or maybe escalate a recommendation to the program governance board for closing the project.`,
            q39: `The correct answer is A: Programs often have a significant level of uncertainty. While the program management plan and program roadmap may document the intended direction and benefits of the program. SPM Page#95`,
            q40: `The correct answer is D: Developing business cases and the potential initiation of new projects or programs to respond to operational issues with the deployed product, service, or capability is being supported or public acceptance/reaction to the improvement or to legislative changes; political, economic, and socioeconomic changes; cultural shifts; or logistics issues with a deployed product, service, capability, or results are being supported. SPM Page# 56. A- is wrong because the business case in the question is not for the main program, it's only for responding to the operational issues with the delivery product. B- is wrong no any development for business case in the identification activities. SPM page# 46. C- is wrong no any development of business cases in the transition activities. SPM Page# 54.`,
            q41: `The correct answer is A: After the program components have produced deliverables and coordinated the successful delivery of their products, services, or results, these components are typically scheduled for closure or transition to operations or ongoing work. The criteria for performing these activities and the organizational expectations are documented in the governance plan. SPM Page# 97. The review of any recommendation for the transition or closure of a program component generally includes 1- Confirming that the business case for the component has been sufficiently satisfied or that further pursuit of the component’s goals should be discontinued.2- Ensuring appropriate program-level communications of the component’s closure to key stakeholders.3- Ensuring component compliance with program-level quality control plans (when required).4- Assessing organizational- or program-level lessons learned as a consequence of the performance of the component in transition.5- Confirm that all other accepted practices for project or program transition or closure have been satisfied. SPM PAGE# 77. B, C, and D are wrong because after the deliverables, results, or benefits of the component are delivered successfully, will typically be scheduled for closure or transition to operations or ongoing work.`,
            q42: `The correct answer is C: Because the transition of the components is done during the delivery phase. Prior to the end of the program delivery phase, all component areas are reviewed to verify that the benefits were delivered and to transition any remaining projects and sustaining activities. SPM PAGE#97. A, B and D are wrong; all are performed during program transition. During program transition, the program steering committee is consulted to determine whether: (a) the program has met all of the desired benefits and that all transition work has been performed within the component transition, or (b) there is another program or sustaining activity that will oversee the ongoing benefits for which this program was chartered. In the second instance, there may be work required to transition the resources, responsibilities, knowledge, and lessons learned to another sustaining entity. Once the transitioning activities are completed, the program manager receives approval from the sponsoring organization to formally close the program. SPM PAGE#97.`,
            q43: `The correct answer is C: Option A is wrong because all components and their contracts already closed and the benefits have been delivered. Option B is wrong because we can’t transition the program without approval from the program steering committee. Option D is wrong because all components already transitioned during the delivery phase. Option C is Correct: For transition or closing the program we have to get approval from the steering committee. The program closure phase includes program activities necessary to transition program benefits to the sustaining organization and formally close the program in a controlled manner. During program transition, the program steering committee is consulted to determine whether: (a) the program has met all of the desired benefits and that all transition work has been performed within the component transition, or (b) there is another program or sustaining activity that will oversee the ongoing benefits for which this program was chartered.

            q45: `The correct answer is D:<br>The program manager has to ensure that the strategies and the plans of both program and its components are responsively adapted to the outcomes of the components, or to changes in the direction or strategies of the sponsoring organization.<br>The outcomes or outputs generated by the components of programs may be unpredictable and uncontrollable. As a consequence, programs should be managed in a way that recognizes the potential need to adapt strategies and plans during the course of a program to optimize the delivery of benefits. A primary role of the program manager is to monitor the outputs and outcomes of a program’s component activities and ensure that the program adapts appropriately to them. Program managers ensure that program components are adapted as required to meet the organization’s strategic objectives. SPM Page# 16.`,
            q46: `The correct answer is D:<br>Here the keyword is Visual. Depending on the nature of the program, the program roadmap is a graphical representation of the incremental benefits and provides a visual of when the return on investment may help fund the future program benefits and outcomes. SPM Page#45<br>We know that the program business case is a documented economic feasibility study used to establish the validity of the benefits to be delivered by a program. But will not provide visual information.`,
            q47: `The correct answer is C:<br>Component projects or programs that do not advance common or complementary goals; or that do not jointly contribute to the delivery of common benefits; or that are related only by common sources of support, technology, or stakeholders are often better managed as portfolios rather than as programs. SPM Page#3.<br>The components of your existing program are not related to the new projects. So cannot be managed as a subsidiary program under your program.<br>The new 15 projects are not related, so you can't manage them as a program or subsidiary program.`,
            q48: `The correct answer is D:<br>A program sponsor is an individual or a group that provides resources and support for the program and is accountable for enabling success. A program steering committee may assume the role of a program sponsor. However, the program sponsor is usually an individual executive who is committed to ensuring that the program is appropriately supported and able to deliver its intended benefits. SPM page# 20.<br>The program sponsor role is frequently filled by an executive member of the program steering committee. SPM PAGE# 80.<br>The program manager does have the power of the steering committee members, so he can't assume the role of the program sponsor.<br>Not any Executive can assume the role of the program sponsor. Because some of them don't know anything about the program.<br>PMO role is different completely from the program sponsor role.`,

            q50: `The correct answer is B:<br>Since your program is not critical to the portfolio, so the priority will be for program X. You have to meet the program manager of program X for optimizing the usage of the scarce resource, and inform your proposal to the sponsor to take the decision because you and program manager X are program managers under the sponsoring portfolio.`,
            q51: `The correct answer is D:<br>It is beneficial to analyze program quality in order to evaluate it across the program with the goal of combining quality tests and inspections in order to reduce costs, where feasible. If the tests are not coordinated, products and deliverables could be tested several times throughout a program and a cost incurred for no valid reason. The quality management plan provides the quality assurance measures and quality controls that are incorporated in the program and the methods of inspection based on the program scope. SPM Page#118.<br>A: This is wrong because the program schedule management plan establishes the criteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The program schedule management plan should include guidance on how changes to schedule baselines are to be coordinated and controlled across program components. SPM Page#122.<br>B: This is wrong because the risk management plan will be reviewed later to address such risks in the future.<br>C: This is wrong because we can't escalate without analysis.`,
            q52: `The correct answer is B:<br>If the risk (R1) of the project1 occurred, you have to subtract the total impact of the risk ($80,000) from the contingency reserve of the project ($145,000). The remaining contingency reserve of project1=145,000 - 80,000= $ 65,000.<br>The program manager may hold contingency reserves at the program level to support risk responses. The program contingency reserve is not a substitute for the component contingency reserve, which is held at the component level.

            q53: `The correct answer is B:<br>During the program schedule assessment in the formulation sub-phase. The initial assessment should state the level of confidence in the assessment of activity durations and identify where alternative activities could be initiated if activities run into excessive delays.
